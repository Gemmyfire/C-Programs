1. Implement the Tournament::Tournament(…) constructor provided such that it loads the data
from the players input file into the m_Players vector and data from the games input file into the
m_Games list without using any user-defined loops.

-find a function which will do this without me having to loop it myself. 
-try: istream& getline(char * array, int n); or input_file.getline(buffer_char_array, buffer_length);
to read in the entire first line of the Players.txt file, putting each thing separated by a whitespace 
into their own array spot
OR std::vector::swap can swap the entire contents of a vector into another vector


2. Implement the Tournament::GenerateResults() function such that it writes the list of players with
their scores in descending order by player score without using any user-defined loops.

-use std::sort() function to sort player list descending by score
-use >> or << operators as overwritten in player class to put players into an output stream
and attach that to pipe into the return string
